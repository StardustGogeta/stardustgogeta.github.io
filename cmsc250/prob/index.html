<h1>Probability and Combinatorics</h1>
If you've ever played a game of Texas Hold'em poker, you're familiar with the fact that certain hands are worth more than others. 
For example, <a href="https://www.cardplayer.com/rules-of-poker/hand-rankings">a flush is better than a straight, and a full house is better than either</a>. Why is this the case?<br>
You may have some intuitive understanding that the more rare a hand is, the higher its rank. Using the ideas discussed here, we will be able to prove this relationship holds.

<h2>Addition and Multiplication Principles</h2>
Combinatorics is all about <i>counting</i>. In particular, we often count the number of ways in which we can perform an action or a set of actions.
The <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/rule-of-sum-and-rule-of-product-problem-solving/">addition and multiplication principles</a> help with this analysis.
<ul>
    <li>The <b>addition principle</b> (or "rule of sum") states that given two different actions where there are `x` choices for the first one
        and `y` choices for the second, there are `x+y` ways of doing either, assuming it is not possible to do both actions simultaneously.</li>
    <li>The <b>multiplication principle</b> (or "rule of product") states that given two different actions where there are `x` choices for the first one
        and `y` choices for the second, there are `xy` ways of performing both actions together (in any order).</li>
</ul>

<card class="card my-3">
    <h5 class="card-header">Example</h5>
    <div class="card-body">
        Consider a person ordering a single meal at an Italian restaurant. The menu has only two items: specialty pizza and salad.
        The salad consists only of lettuce and dressing, where there are three choices of lettuce and two types of dressing.
        Meanwhile, the pizza comes in one of four different pre-made varieties. How many total meal options are there?
        <hr>
        We have two choices, pizza or salad, so we count the number of possible salads and the number of possible pizzas and add them together by the addition principle.
        The pizza clearly has only four options, as was given. However, counting the number of salad choices we have requires the multiplication rule.
        With `3` choices of lettuce and `2` choices of dressing, we have `2\times3=6` ways of picking one of each to form a salad.
        Thus, we obtain a final answer of `4+6=10` total possible meal selections.

<h2>Combinations and Permutations</h2>
Two fundamental concepts in the field of combinatorics are those of <b>combinations</b> and <b>permutations</b>.<br>
A permutation is an ordering of some collection of elements.
<!--<sup><a tabindex="0" role="button" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-trigger="hover" data-bs-content="Some sources make the distinction that the permutation is not the collection itself but simply the ordering. This makes no practical difference.">[1]</a></sup>-->
The number of possible permutations of a set of `n` distinct elements is simply given by `n!`, where `!` denotes the factorial function.
<card class="card my-3">
    <h5 class="card-header">Derivation</h5>
    <div class="card-body">
        Suppose we have a set of `n` distinct elements. We want to create one permutation of this set.<br>
        We begin by picking the first element of the permutation. There are `n` elements to choose from, so there are `n` ways of doing this.
        Then, we select the second element of the permutation. There are now only `n-1` elements remaining, so there are `n-1` ways of doing this.
        We repeat until we have exhausted all elements of the original set, leaving only one choice for the last element in the permutation.
        By the multiplication principle, there are `n\cdot(n-1)\cdots1=n!` ways of performing this entire task.<br>
        Every unique sequence of choices results in a new permutation (and every permutation can be constructed in this manner),
        so there are exactly `n!` possible permutations of the original set.
    </div>
</card>

An ordering of `k` elements from a set of `n` elements is called a `k`-permutation. The number of possible `k`-permutations from a set of size `n` is given by
$$P(n, k)={}_nP_k=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.$$

<card class="card my-3">
    <h5 class="card-header">Derivation</h5>
    <div class="card-body">
        Suppose we have a set of `n` distinct elements. We want to create a permutation of size `k` from this set.<br>
        We begin by picking the first element of the permutation. There are `n` elements to choose from, so there are `n` ways of doing this.
        Then, we select the second element of the permutation. There are now only `n-1` elements remaining, so there are `n-1` ways of doing this.
        We repeat for a total of `k` elements, leaving `n-k` elements unselected.
        By the multiplication principle, there are `n\cdot(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)=n!/(n-k)!` ways of performing this entire task.<br><br>
        Alternatively, we can first notice that there are `n!` permutations of all elements in the original set. By extracting the first `k` elements of
        any given permutation, we construct a `k`-permutation as desired. However, there are `n-k` elements not selected, and the `k`-permutation is repeated
        once for each of their `(n-k)!` possible arrangements. Dividing out the number of repetitions yields `n!/(n-k)!` as before.
    </div>
</card>

A combination is simply a set of elements without respect to order. For instance, the set `\{1, 5, 7\}` is a combination of three odd numbers.
This is <i>exactly the same</i> as the combinations `\{5, 7, 1\}`, `\{1, 7, 5\}`, etc., since order does not matter.<br>

The number of possible combinations of `k` elements from a set of size `n` is given by
$$C(n, k)={}_nC_k=\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.$$



<h2>Preliminary Probability Definitions</h2>
There are a few ideas we need to define immediately. A lot of this may be familiar or intuitive, but it is still important to discuss.
A good source of information can be found <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~Janice.Epstein/141/review/WIR10_Prob_1.pdf">here</a>, summarized below.
Other resources include <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/complementary-events/">Statistics How To</a> and <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Experiment.html">Wolfram MathWorld</a>,
though the latter can be fairly technical.
<ul>
    <li>An <b>experiment</b> is an activity with an observable result. (ex. Rolling a die)</li>
    <li>An <b>outcome</b> is a possible result of an experiment. (ex. Rolling a 5)</li>
    <li>The <b>sample space</b> is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. (Rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6)</li>
    <li>An <b>event</b> is a subset of the sample space. (Rolling a 1, 3, or 5)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>An event can include some, none, or all of the events in the sample space.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The <b>probability</b> of an event is the chance that it occurs.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If all outcomes in a sample space have the same probability, then the probability of an event `E` occurring is simply
            the ratio of the number of outcomes in `E` to the total number of outcomes in the sample space.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Two events are <b>disjoint / mutually exclusive</b> if they share no outcomes.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Alternatively, we might say that the intersection of the two events is empty.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Two events are <b>complementary</b> if they are disjoint and their union is the sample space (so exactly one must occur).</li>
    <li>Two events `A` and `B` are <b>independent</b> if the probability of `A` does not depend on whether `B` occurs, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
Several of these concepts involve basic set theory like union and intersection, so be sure to understand the meanings of those terms first.
