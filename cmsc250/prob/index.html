<h1>Probability and Combinatorics</h1>
If you've ever played a game of Texas Hold'em poker, you're familiar with the fact that certain hands are worth more than others. 
For example, <a href="https://www.cardplayer.com/rules-of-poker/hand-rankings">a flush is better than a straight, and a full house is better than either</a>. Why is this the case?<br>
You may have some intuitive understanding that the more rare a hand is, the higher its rank. Using the ideas discussed here, we will be able to prove this relationship holds.

<h2>Combinations and Permutations</h2>
Two fundamental concepts in the field of combinatorics are those of <b>combinations</b> and <b>permutations</b>.<br>
A permutation is an ordering of some collection of elements.
<!--<sup><a tabindex="0" role="button" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-trigger="hover" data-bs-content="Some sources make the distinction that the permutation is not the collection itself but simply the ordering. This makes no practical difference.">[1]</a></sup>-->
The number of possible permutations of a set of `n` distinct elements is simply given by `n!`, where `!` denotes the factorial function.

    <div class="card-body">
        Suppose we have a set of `n` distinct elements. We want to create one permutation of this set.<br>
        We begin by picking the first element of the permutation. There are `n` elements to choose from, so there are `n` ways of doing this.
        Then, we select the second element of the permutation. There are now only `n-1` elements remaining, so there are `n-1` ways of doing this.
        We repeat until we have exhausted all elements of the original set, leaving only one choice for the last element in the permutation.
        By the multiplication principle, there are `n\cdot(n-1)\cdots1=n!` ways of performing this entire task.<br>
        Every unique sequence of choices results in a new permutation (and every permutation can be constructed in this manner),
        so there are exactly `n!` possible permutations of the original set.
