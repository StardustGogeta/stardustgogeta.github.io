		<h1>KerbalSpace - Embedding Python</h1>
		<h3>&lt;python&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[pythonCode]<br>&lt;/python&gt;</h3>
		<div class='exp'>Between tags reminiscent of HTML, Python code can be directly inserted into a KerbalSpace document.
		This will only work when the tags appear on their own lines, and does not work for
		partial lines of code.</div>
		<h3>--[pythonCode]</h3>
		<div class='exp'>Immediately after two dashes in a row appear at the start of a line,
		the line is transcribed directly into the output Python file. This can be used like above,
		but is intended for single lines which are currently missing counterparts within KerbalSpace.
		Do not place whitespace after the dashes if it is not meant to be included in the transciption.</div>
