<h1>Basic Terminology</h1>
The study of differential equations is very broad, as it essentially describes any system which undergoes change.
There are a few key words to know when discussing or describing these sorts of equations.<br><br>
A <b>differential equation</b> is one that relates a function to its derivatives. For instance, `y=3y'-2` and `\left(y''\right)^2=\pi` are both differential equations.<br><br>
A function is <b>homogeneous</b> if and only if multiplying its arguments by a scalar will multiply its value by some power of that scalar.
In the context of differential equations, this can be taken to mean that there is no constant term. The differential equation is a polynomial in `y` and its derivatives.
For instance, the equation `y(x-1)=y''` is homogeneous, but `y'=x+y` is not.<br><br>
A differential equation is <b>linear</b> if the highest power of the unknown function `y` or any of its derivatives is one.<br>
The equation `y'=3xy+2-x^3` is linear but `y^2=y''+3x` is not.<br><br>
The <b>order</b> of a differential equation is the highest order of derivation of the unknown function. For instance, `y^{(4)}-y''+y=0` is a fourth-order differential equation
and `y'=y+x^4` is a first-order differential equation.<br><br>
