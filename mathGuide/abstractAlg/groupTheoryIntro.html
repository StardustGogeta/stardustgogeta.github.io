<h1>Introduction to Group Theory</h1>
An <b>algebraic structure</b> is a <b>set</b> with a collection of operations (with finite numbers of inputs) that may act upon it.<br>
<b>Groups</b> are a particular subset of algebraic structures: they must have at least one binary operator and satisfy the following four axioms / requirements:<br>
<ol>
    <li>Associativity: `\forall a,b,c\in\mathbb X, (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c)`</li>
    <li>Closure: `\forall a, b \in \mathbb X, a \oplus b = c \implies c\in\mathbb X`</li>
    <li>Identity Element: `\exists i\in\mathbb X: \forall a\in\mathbb X, a\oplus i = i\oplus a = a`</li>
    <li>Inversion: `\forall a\in\mathbb X, \exists b\in\mathbb X: a\oplus b = b\oplus a = i`, where `i` is the identity element</li>
</ol>
(On this page, `\mathbb X` represents an arbitrary set and `\oplus` an arbitrary operator)<br>
TODO: Link set notation<br><br>
Groups can be defined using set notation to describe the set and the operator, and this combination forms <b>group theory notation</b>. <sup><a href='https://math.stackexchange.com/a/578185/335369'>[src]</a></sup><br>
For instance, `(\mathbb Z, +)` denotes the "set of integers under addition" and `(\mathbb Q \setminus\{0\}, \cdot)` notates the "set of rationals (excluding zero) under multiplication".<br>
In general, this can be written as `(\mathbb X, \oplus)`.<br>
<b>Important Note</b>: `(\mathbb Q, \cdot)` is not a group because there is no element `b` for which `0\cdot b=1`. <sup><a href='https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1111164/335369'>[src]</a></sup><br><br>
<b>Rings</b> are composed of a set and <u>two</u> binary operations, and they obey the "ring axioms": <sup><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)#Definition'>[src]</a></sup><br>
<ol>
    <li>The set is an Abelian group under addition.</li>
    <li>Multiplication is associative and there exists a multiplicative identity.</li>
    <li>Multiplication is distributive over addition.</li>
</ol>
Multiplication must maintain closure, but it is not necessarily commutative and does not need to be invertible.<br>
A ring without a multiplicative identity is called a <b>rng</b>, or alternatively, a <b>pseudo-ring</b> ("pseudo-ring" is slightly ambiguous and should be avoided). <sup><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rng_(algebra)'>[src]</a></sup><br>
A ring in which the operation of multiplication is commutative is said to be a <b>commutative ring</b>.<br>
In a commutative ring, if there is an element `a` such that `a\neq 0` and `\exists b:a\cdot b=0`, `a` is said to be a <b>zero divisor</b>.<br>
A commutative ring with no zero divisors is known as an <b>integral domain</b>, and an example is the set of integers `\mathbb Z`. <sup><a href='https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~alopez-o/math-faq/mathtext/node6.html'>[src]</a></sup><br><br>
<b>Fields</b> are rings in which the elements of a ring (excluding the zero) comprise an Abelian group with the second operation.<br>
This means that in addition to the ring axioms, fields have commutativity of multiplication and multiplicative inverses.<br>
An example of a field is the set of rational numbers, `\mathbb Q`.<br><br>
<b>Important Note</b>: In the context of group theory, `0` and `1` are often defined as the additive and multiplicative identities,
where "addition" [`+`] and "multiplication" [ `\cdot` ] are default names and symbols given to the two operations involved.
These often, but not always, coincide with the conventional usages.<br><br>
<h2>Key Words</h2>
<b>Abelian groups</b> are those for which the operator is <b>commutative</b>: `\forall a,b\in\mathbb X, a\oplus b=b\oplus a`.<br>
<b>Subgroups</b> are groups that are subsets of larger groups, still obeying all four key axioms.<br>
<b>Group homomorphisms</b> are functions `f:\mathbb X\to\mathbb Y` such that, with groups `(\mathbb X, \oplus)` and `(\mathbb Y, \boxdot)` and `a,b\in\mathbb X, f(a\oplus b)=f(a)\boxdot f(b)`.<br>
<b>Isomorphisms</b> are a subset of homomorphisms, those which have inverse functions that are also homomorphisms.<br>
This implies that isomorphisms are <b><a href='../injection.html'>bijective</a> (homo)morphisms</b>. Composing isomorphisms forms an "<b>identity function</b>".<br>
Two groups that admit an isomorphism are called "<b>isomorphic</b>". This is written as `\mathbb A \cong\mathbb B` for groups with underlying sets `\mathbb A` and `\mathbb B`. <sup><a href='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Isomorphism.html'>[src]</a></sup><br><br>
<b>Automorphisms</b> are isomorphisms of a object, often a group, which map the object unto itself. <sup><a href='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Automorphism.html'>[src]</a></sup><br>
The set of these (along with function composition) forms an "<b>automorphism group</b>". <sup><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism#Automorphism_group'>[src]</a></sup><br>
<b>Important Note</b>: This will form a group, no matter if the original object was a group, ring, module, or other structure. <sup><a href='https://math.stackexchange.com/a/194341/335369'>[src]</a></sup><br>
Automorphism groups must satisfy the following four requirements, analogous to those identified for groups above:
<ol>
    <li>Associativity: Composition of automorphisms is associative.</li>
    <li>Closure: Composing any two automorphisms will produce another automorphism.</li>
    <li>Identity Element: The identity function is an automorphism, so it is included by definition.</li>
    <li>Inversion: All automorphisms in the group have inverse functions by definition.</li>
</ol>
