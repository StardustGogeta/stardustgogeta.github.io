<h1>First-Order Logic</h1>
In set theory (and mathematics in general), there is a language ("formal system") used to formalize statements and axioms known as <b>first-order logic</b>.
Alternatively known as <b>predicate logic</b>, this allows for general statements to be made about sets and their elements, among other things.
There is a traditional collection of symbols used in first-order logic, including equality (`=`), conjunction / intersection (`\land`), disjunction / union (`\lor`),
implication (`\to`), biconditional (`\leftrightarrow`), negation (`\neg`), "for all" (`\forall`), and "exists" (`\exists`). These are also used with arbitrary variables and conventional punctuation.<br><br>
Contrast this with <b>propositional logic</b>, which uses only implication and negation to describe cause-and-effect relationships.
Both propositional and predicate logic use collections of symbols, operators, axioms, and inference rules (such as <i>modus ponens</i>) in order to establish the respective systems.<br>
<i>Modus Ponens</i>: `P \land (P\to Q)\to Q`<br><br>
In <b>second-order logic</b>, predicates and subsets can be described and quantified, unlike in first-order logic, which deals only in individual elements and relations.
Another limitation is that first-order logic cannot uniquely describe infinite structures like the `\mathbb N` or `\mathbb R`, while second-order logic can.
For instance, second-order logic can express the property that every subset of the naturals has a lowest element, but, by definition, first-order logic cannot.<br><br>
<b>Higher-order logic</b> is an extension of this concept. First-order logic quantifies over individuals, second-order logic quantifies over sets, third-order logic quantifies over sets of sets, and so on.
As part of this naming scheme, propositional logic is sometimes labelled "zeroth-order logic", as each higher order logic system is a superset of the constructions of those below it.<br><br>
It is a famous result as part of <b>GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem</b> that no formal system which models Peano arithmetic can be simultaneously...<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Sound</b>: Everything valid in the system is true</li>
    <li><b>Complete</b>: Everything true is valid in the system</li>
    <li><b>Effective</b>: There exists a terminating proof-checking decision algorithm</li>
</ul>
In other words, no system can assert its own consistency, nor can it prove / disprove every possible statement made.
