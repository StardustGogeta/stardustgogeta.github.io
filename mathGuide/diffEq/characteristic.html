<h1>Characteristic Equations</h1>
One method of solving linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients is by finding the corresponding "characteristic equation."<br>
For a differential equation written as `\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^na_ny^{(n)}=0` with constant coefficients `a_n`,
the characteristic equation is given by `p(z)=\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^na_nz^{n}`.<br><br>
Assume that `a_0=1` for simplicity. If `a_0\ne1`, then divide the entire equation by `a_0` to obtain a new one which satisfies the assumption.<br>
Using the differential operator `D=\mathrm d/\mathrm dx`, we can see that `p(D)=D^n+a_1D^{n-1}+\ldots+a_nI` where `I` is the identity operator.<br>
With this in mind, we can rewrite the differential equation as `p(D)(y)=0`. Hence, finding a function which "kills" `p(D)` (sends it to zero) is an equivalent task to solving the differential equation.<br>
Using the "ansatz" (educated guess) of `y=e^{rt}`, we can try evaluating `p(D)(e^{rt})` below.<br><br>

`p(D)(e^{rt})=D^n(e^{rt})+a_1D^{n-1}(e^{rt})+\ldots+a_n(e^{rt})=r^n(e^{rt})+a_1r^{n-1}(e^{rt})+\ldots+a_n(e^{rt})=p(r)\cdot e^{rt}\implies\boxed{p(D)(e^{rt})=p(r)e^{rt}}`<br><br>

This finding is of tremendous importance, and for this reason it is sometimes called the "key identity." <sup><a href="https://www.math.umd.edu/~immortal/MATH246/C2-6-1-KI.pdf">[src]</a></sup>
(Note that in a sense, one can think of this as stating that `e^{rt}` is an eigenvector of the linear mapping `p(D)` from the set of infinitely differentiable functions to itself.)
Recall that the task at hand was finding a function which kills `p(D)`. Using the key identity, we know that this is accomplished with the function `y=e^{rt}` whenever `r` is a root of `p`, the characteristic polynomial.<br><br>
This is a great breakthrough, but there are now some different cases we must consider, depending on the distinctness of the roots and whether they are real or complex.<br><br>

<h2>Distinct Roots</h2>
When all roots of the characteristic equation are distinct, we can prove easily that this method generates a fundamental set of solutions.<br>
Let `e^{r_1t}, e^{r_2t},\ldots,e^{r_nt}` be solutions found for an `n`<sup>th</sup>-order differential equation using the key identity.
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1451686/335369">It can be shown</a> that the linear independence of these exponentials
follows directly from <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/696329/335369">the fact</a> that <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/29374/335369">eigenvectors which correspond to different eigenvalues are linearly independent</a>.

    In a sense, one can think of this as stating that `e^{rt}` is an eigenvector of the linear `D` operator with distinct eigenvalue `r`. The fact that different eigenvalues implies
    linear independence is intuitively obvious. Take eigenvectors `\vec v_1` and `\vec v_2` with eigenvalues `a` and `b`, respectively. If `\vec v_1` and `\vec v_2` were scalar multiples of one another,
    then applying the transformation to the shared unit vector `\vec u=\dfrac{\vec v_1}{\|\vec v_1\|}=\dfrac{\vec v_2}{\|\vec v_2\|}` should result in `T(u)=a\vec u=b\vec u`.
    From this, we immediately gather that `a=b`, implied from the fact that the two eigenvectors shared a direction. Thus, using the contrapositive, we find that `a\ne b` implies `v_1` and `v_2` are linearly independent.

Since there are `n` linearly independent solutions to an `n`<sup>th</sup>-order differential equation, they must form a fundamental set.
Therefore, each distinct root of the characteristic equation corresponds to a term in the general solution to the differential equation. For roots `\alpha_0`, `\alpha_1`, `\alpha_2`, etc.,
the general solution is `\displaystyle y=c_0e^{\alpha_0x}+c_1e^{\alpha_1x}+c_2e^{\alpha_2x}+\cdots` for constant coefficients `c_n`.<br><br>

<h2>Repeated Roots</h2>
Using the fundamental theorem of algebra, let `p(z)=(z-r_1)^{m_1}(z-r_2)^{m_2}\cdots(z-r_i)^{m_i}\cdots(z-r_k)^{m_k}` where we have multiplicities `m\in\mathbb N_+` and at least one `m` is greater than `1`. Without loss of generality, let one such `m` be `m_i`.
Rewrite the function as `p(z)=a(z)(z-r_i)^{m_i}` for an arbitrary polynomial `a(z)` created by grouping together the other factors. Differentiating, we obtain
`p'(z)=a'(z)(z-r_i)^{m_i}+m_ia(z)(z-r_i)^{m_i-1}=\left(a'(z)(z-r_i)+m_ia(z)\right)\cdot(z-r_i)^{m_i-1}`. We can conclude that, since `m_i-1>0`, we know `r_i` is still a root of `p'(z)`.<br><br>

This fact will allow us to generate another solution to the differential equation based on the original. Let `L=p(D)` for clarity, so that we can write `L(e^{rt})=p(r)e^{rt}`. Taking the
partial derivative with respect to `r` on both sides, we find that `L(te^{rt})=p'(r)e^{rt}+tp(r)e^{rt}`. Hence, any repeated root `r` of the characteristic equation `p` will kill both terms
on the right-hand side, and it is proven that `te^{rt}` is also a solution to the differential equation. In general, using this technique with a root of multiplicity `m` can generate `m` solutions
in the form `e^{rt},te^{rt},\ldots,t^{m-1}e^{rt}`, and doing this for each root will result in a fundamental set of solutions. In other words, if there are repeated roots, then there is not an arbitrary coefficient, but rather an arbitrary polynomial in `t`.
For instance, the characteristic equation `p(r)=(r-2)^3(r-5)` provides us with the general solution `y=c_0t^2e^{2t}+c_1te^{2t}+c_2e^{2t}+c_3e^{5t}`, which can be written more simply as `y=e^{2t}\left(c_0t^2+c_1t+c_2\right)+c_3e^{5t}`.<br><br>

<h2>Complex Roots</h2>
When some or all of the roots of the characteristic equation are complex, we are primarily interested in using these results to recover real-valued solutions to the differential equation. In fact, assuming that
the coefficients of the differential equation are all real, we can make a number of developments toward this end. Since all coefficients of the characteristic equation are real, we know that its complex roots
come in conjugate pairs, `r=a+bi` and `\overline r=a-bi`.

<br><br><div class="card"><div class="card-body">
    This fact about the complex conjugate pairs may not be immediately obvious. Note that what we are trying to prove is that `p(z)=0\implies p(\overline z)=0`. Start with `p(z)=z^n+a_1z^{n-1}+\ldots+a_n=0` and
    take the conjugate of both sides, giving `\overline{z^n+a_1z^{n-1}+\ldots+a_n}=0`. By the properties `\overline{x+y}=\overline x + \overline y` and `\overline{x\cdot y}=\overline x\cdot\overline y`, we can see that `{\overline z}^n+a_1{\overline z}^{n-1}+\ldots+a_n=p(\overline z)=0`,
    as we set about to prove. <sup><a href="http://mathonline.wikidot.com/pairs-of-complex-roots-for-polynomials-with-real-coefficient">[src]</a></sup>
</div></div><br>

We can then state that, by Euler's formula, `e^{\overline rt}=\overline{e^{rt}}`, so if `y=e^{rt}` is a solution, then so is `\overline y`. Using the facts that `\mathrm{Re}(z)=\dfrac{z+\overline z}2` and `\mathrm{Im}(z)=\dfrac{z-\overline z}{2i}`,
we see that `\mathrm{Re}(y)=e^{at}\cos(bt)` and `\mathrm{Im}(y)=e^{at}\sin(bt)` are each linear combinations of the solutions `y` and `\overline y`, and it can be shown
that this pair will also be linearly independent for `b\ne0`.

<br><br><div class="card"><div class="card-body">
    The linear independence of these new solutions can be proven quite easily. Assume the contrary, so that there exist some constants `c_1` and `c_2` such that `c_1e^{at}\cos(bt)+c_2e^{at}\sin(bt)=0` and `c_1` and `c_2` are not both zero.
    Since `e^{at}\ne0`, we can divide by `e^{at}` to obtain `c_1\cos(bt)+c_2\sin(bt)=0`. When `t=0`, we have `c_1=0`, so `c_2\sin(bt)=0`. Take `b\ne0`, so that at `t=\dfrac{\pi}{2b}` we have `c_2=0` and the
    two constants `c_1` and `c_2` are both zero, so the two solutions are linearly independent. On the other hand, if `b=0`, then `\mathrm{Im}(y)` simply equals zero, and the two are not linearly independent.
    However, this corresponds to the case where `r` has no complex part, so this case can effectively be ignored.
</div></div><br>

<h2>Summary</h2>
In general, these different cases can be combined into one rule to follow for all roots of the characteristic equation, regardless of the multiplicity or whether it is real or complex.<br><br>

If `r=a+bi\in\mathbb C` is a root with multiplicity `m`, then the differential equation has solutions `e^{at}\cos(bt),te^{at}\cos(bt),\ldots,t^{m-1}e^{at}\cos(bt)` and `e^{at}\sin(bt),te^{at}\sin(bt),\ldots,t^{m-1}e^{at}\sin(bt)`.
This results in `m` linearly independent solutions for each real root (since the `\sin(bt)` terms are all zero and contribute nothing) and `2m` linearly independent solutions for each pair of complex roots
of the characteristic equation. (Note that this implies that a linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients of degree `d` will have exactly `d` linearly independent solutions.)
